# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.3] - 2023-10-23

This is the first release after maintenance was assumed by https://github.com/stdedos.

The focus of this release was to improve automation:
* Fix the continuous integration,
* Run tests as part of branches and PRs,
* Use `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file to upkeep the code quality, and
* Automate the release process

There should be no functional changes in this release, although there are changes in the source code.

A heartfelt thank you to https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas for his invaluable contributions to the continued maintenance of this project!
