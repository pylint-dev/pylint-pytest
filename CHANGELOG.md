## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0a0] - 2024-02-02

### Added

* Increased reproducibility of the project, by using `pip-compile` for the development dependencies
  (https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint-pytest/pull/28, small bugfix in https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint-pytest/pull/39)
* Introduced @dependabot (part of https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint-pytest/pull/28)

### Removed

* Support for Python 3.6 & 3.7 (https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint-pytest/pull/23)

### Improved

* Migrate setup.py to pyproject.toml (https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint-pytest/pull/8)
* Support for Python 3.12 (https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint-pytest/issues/3,
  "side effect" of https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint-pytest/pull/8)
* Improved reliability of the `FixtureChecker` class (https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint-pytest/pull/29)
* Minor CI + License updates (in 29f0c33, e0e529a, 8f56d1c)

## [1.1.7] - 2023-12-04

This is a small release to support additionally Pylint v3.
It should be noted, however, that for linting, Pylint must be v3 or newer (due to backwards-incompatible changes).

### Fixed

* Support pylint v3 and drop v1 (https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint-pytest/pull/27)

## [1.1.6] - 2023-11-20

This is a small bugfix release.

This will probably be the last bugfix release in the v1 series.
We MAY support Python 3.12 in the v1 series if support appears to be trivial.

### Fixed

* üêõ Ignore collection failures in non-tests (https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint-pytest/pull/15)
* Minor `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` improvement (https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint-pytest/commit/22650f9912bcdc6a1bc4b3166f70bba7339aba7c)

## [1.1.5] - 2023-11-13

This is a small bugfix release.

### Fixed

* removes more false positives for unused-argument (https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint-pytest/pull/21)
* A collection of minor improvements to tests (https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint-pytest/pull/26)
* Windows Artifacts have incorrect Slugification (https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint-pytest/pull/25)

## [1.1.4] - 2023-11-06

This is a small bugfix release.

### Fixed

* `anis-campos/fix_is_pytest_fixture` (https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint-pytest/pull/2)
  Astroid has different semantics when using `import pytest` or `from pytest import ...`,
  which affects the detection of pytest fixtures.

### Improved

* `pre-commit`: (https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint-pytest/pull/20)
  * Added more checks to the `pre-commit` hook.

        hooks:
          - id: python-no-log-fatal
            name: avoid logger.fatal(
    ```
  * Unified formatting (always expanded arrays; not covered by linters, sadly)

## [1.1.3] - 2023-10-23

This is the first release after maintenance was assumed by https://github.com/stdedos.

The focus of this release was to improve automation:
* Fix the continuous integration,
* Run tests as part of branches and PRs,
* Use `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file to upkeep the code quality, and
* Automate the release process

There should be no functional changes in this release, although there are changes in the source code.

A heartfelt thank you to https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas for his invaluable contributions to the continued maintenance of this project!
